[Click here to view simulation.](https://satyajit09.github.io/Boids_Simulation/)
An Interactive artificial life simulation of schools of fish based on the ’Boids Algorithm’ by Craig Reynolds, developed
using JavaScript and the p5.js library. Each ’Boid’ has been implemented as an independent entity whose movement is
governed by the rules applied to them. Individual Boids interact with each-other and simulate a flocking behaviour.
